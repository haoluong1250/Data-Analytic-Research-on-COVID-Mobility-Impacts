    "With the rise of remote work and social isolation, COVID-19 significantly changed individuals’ mobility patterns. We saw the rapid development of services such as grocery delivery, telecommunication, etc that enabled individuals to work and live from inside their homes. However, there exists a disparity in which populations have access to these services and populations who have no choice but to thrust themselves in the midst of the COVID outbreak. We hypothesize that these differences reflect in the mobility patterns between different regions during COVID-19, with “mobility patterns” defined as the number of visitors over time to locations under the categories of: Retail & Recreation, Grocery & Pharmacy, Parks, Transit Stations, Workplaces, and Residential Areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question we aim to explore is: during COVID-19, how did factors -- such as difference in income levels, education, and COVID relief -- impact mobility patterns in the Bay Area and Central Valley?\n",
    "\n",
    "We selected these two regions because of the vast disparity in demographics between the Bay Area and Central Valley. While the Bay Area features many high-income, white-collar tech workers, Central Valley is composed mainly of blue-collar workers, such as “grocers, farm workers and warehouse employees” [^mays2017]. These demographic differences significantly shape the mobility patterns of each group in their day-to-day lives, whether during COVID-19 or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensive research has been done on the unequal impact of COVID-19 on different income brackets, with low-income workers bearing the greatest load of COVID cases and deaths [^masterson2023].\n",

    "\n",
    "A myriad of factors amplify low-income communities’ vulnerabilities to COVID-19, including higher population density, decreased medical care, increased public transportation use, and more. Due to blue collar workers lacking the affordance of remote work, one contributing factor includes increased mobility. Previous studies ([^basselini2021], [^bonvini2022], [^jason2022], [Vega-Villalobos2022] ) have discovered that mobility significantly impacts the chances of COVID19 spread:  “We identified that a 1% increase in mobility yielded a 5.2 and a 2.9% increase in the risk of COVID-19 incidence and mortality, respectively. Mobility was estimated to contribute 8.5 and 3.8% to the variability in incidence and mortality, respectively“ [^Méndez-Lizárraga2022].  In particular, mobility to locations under the categories of retail and recreation and workplaces hold the strongest association with chances of COVID-19 incidence and death [^irini2021].\n",

    "The ideal dataset to answer our research question focuses on relevant COVID19 factors in the Bay Area and the Central Valleys with respect to how they affect mobility during COVID19. Ideally, our dataset should focus on the Bay Area and Central Valley’s household income, educational attainment, vaccination patterns, COVID relief packages, and quarantining mandates. Because the research question aims to analyze the Bay Area and the Central Valley, the datasets should focus on those locations. However, understanding that the Bay Area and the Central Valley are large geographical areas, the ideal datasets can discuss these locations on a general scale or on a more micro-scale such as on a county-level or a city-level. Beyond locations, the datasets of income, education, COVID relief allocation, vaccination patterns, and infection rates ultimately are collected from the behaviors of people affected. Because our datasets are sourced from state-level and county-level data, we expect to have thousands to tens of thousands of observations per dataset. Having too few observations or even having too many observations to work with can analyzing and data management difficult. Ideally, we want to have observations sampled that is manageable while remaining representative. Our data ideally shold be organized through analytic models such as decision trees, EDA, or a correlation map for example.\n",
